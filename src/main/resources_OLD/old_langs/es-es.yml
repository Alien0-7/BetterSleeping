# CONFIGURATION GUIDE:
# The symbol '&' is used for color codes
# Any message can be disabled by setting the text to "ignored" or "", an example can be found below
# some_setting: "ignored"
# another_setting: ""


# BetterSleeping offers support for several placeholders:
# <current_amount>
#     Replaced by:      The current amount of something.
#     Can be used in:   cancelled, amount_left
#     Example:          When 5 players are sleeping, it will be replaced by 5
# <amount>
#     Replaced by:      The correct number in that context.
#     Can be used in:   cancelled, amount_left, buff_received, no_buff_received
#     Example:          When 5 players are sleeping and 7 are required, it will be replaced by 2
#     Example:          When 3 buffs are enabled, it will be replaced by 3
# <total_amount>
#     Replaced by:      The correct total amount needed in that context, not considering the current amount
#     Can be used in:   cancelled, amount_left
#     Example:          When 7 sleeping players are required, it will be replaced by 7. Even when 2 are sleeping
# <time>
#     Replaced by:      The correct time (in seconds or minutes)
#     Can be used in:   enough_sleeping, sleep_spam, disable_skip
#     Example:          When enough players are sleeping, it will be replaced by the time it takes to skip the night (sleep_delay) in seconds
#     Example:          When a player enters their bed within the cooldown time, it is replaced by the time they need to wait in seconds
#     Example:          When a player disabled sleeping in a world for a while, the waiting time can be used in minutes
# <receiver>
#     Replaced by:      The player receiving the message
#     Can be used in:   Every message!
#     Example:          When user Freddy_Krueger receives a message, it will be replaced by Freddy_Krueger
# <user>
#     Replaced by:      The player who did an action (enter or leave a bed for example)
#     Can be used in:   cancelled, amount_left
#     Example:          When user Freddy_Krueger leaves or enters a bed, it is replaced by Freddy_Krueger
# <world>
#     Replaced by:      The name of the relevant world
#     Can be used in:   enable_skip
#     Example:          The night in world 'Overworld' can be skipped again: <world> is replaced by 'Overworld'


# Singular/plural nouns are taken in account too!
# Simply add [singular.plural] in an applicable message and it will be correctly substituted.
# The <amount> tag is always used as reference. This means that <current_amount> or <total_amount> are not considered in this process.
# Can be used in:   enough_sleeping, buff_received, no_buff_received, cancelled, amount_left, sleep_spam, disable_skip
# Example: <amount> more [player.players] [is.are] needed!
#          When 1 more player is needed, the singular sides will be taken: 1 more player is needed
#          Otherwise, the plural sides will be chosen: 5 more players are needed
