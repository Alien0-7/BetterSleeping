# Notice about files in this folder
These files are not to be redistributed. They do **not** fall under the LICENSE of BetterSleeping.
They are not mine and are not shared in any BetterSleeping release in any way, shape or form. 
Their only purpose is to allow other people to easily build BetterSleeping after cloning, without any extra setup steps.
Libraries in this folder are solely used as dependencies to ensure compatibility and make developing this plugin easier.
For each file, an official download location can be found in the table below.

If you are the owner of any library in this folder and want your artifact removed, give me a notice through an issue and I will remove them at once.
Keep in mind that support for your plugin may be dropped, until it can be included as a Maven dependency to keep cloning the project simple.
