## What this plugin does
Usually all players must sleep before a night/storm can be skipped on a multiplayer server.
BetterSleeping allows this to be skipped when a given percentage of players is sleeping.
Quite extensive configuration is included to suit your needs. The configuration includes, but is not limited to:
 - Set the night skip mode: will **time pass faster** or will it be set to day?
 - Set a **percentage** of players that must sleep to skip the night, or choose to set a **static amount** that must sleep
 - All messages can be **customised** in lang.yml, and by default several languages are supported (English, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese)
 - Give players **buffs** (potion effects) for sleeping or **debuffs** for not sleeping!
 - **Disable phantoms**
 - Display **messages on screen** instead of in the chat
 - ... And **so much more**! Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Nuytemans-Dieter/BetterSleeping/wiki) to see all options.
